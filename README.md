Automated tests for [my personal website](https://nathanfriend.io).

[View the source on GitLab.](https://gitlab.com/nfriend/website-3.0-tests)

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo
1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
1. Run `yarn test` to run tests (or `yarn test --watch` to re-test when files
   are saved)

## About the tests

These tests run against the live version of https://nathanfriend.io. Because of
this, it's wise to make sure the tests aren't being too aggressive ğŸ™‚. However,
this shouldn't be too much of an issue since the tests [are rate
limited](./tests/setup.js).
